INTRODUCTION

Macklemore Supermarket, a prominent retail chain in Europe, experienced a slow growth followed by a decline in profit between 2010 and 2017. This analysis evaluates its profitability by examining key financial metrics such as revenue, profitable products and countries.

Ensuring absence of duplicated rows.
Ensuring the date entries are standardized to a uniform date format.
STANDARD EXCEL TABLE: The dataset was transformed to a standard excel table for easier management and automation.

I conducted a pre-analysis process on the dataset before analyzing the dataset on pivot chart. This pre-analysis involves breaking the dataset into meaningful components.

Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.
Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing when the analysis starts proper.
Potential Insights: I was able too uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.
Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.
